To patch your legally acquired Pokémon Diamond ROM, go to **https://www.marcrobledo.com/RomPatcher.js/** and use the .xDelta patch of your choice provided in the release section.

### Please note: this patch requires the **(USA) (Rev 5) Version** of Diamond to work correctly.<br>If you find anything wrong with my patches, or have any suggestions for improvements, please let me know through my DMs on Discord. You can find me in the **[IronMON Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/jFPYsZAhjX) (user ID: sentor_g)**.

## Why is my game crashing?
Pokémon Diamond & Pearl were released in April 2007 and Platinum was released in September 2008. In between that time frame, significant improvements were made to the engine which made Platinum, from a ROM hackers perspective, easier to work with and manipulate/edit. This also means that alternate forms of Pokémon, such as Deoxys, Rotom and Wormadam, will break the game.<br><br>I have formulated a <ins>**4.6.1** randomiser string</ins> to be used for Diamond Kaizo IronMON runs: `322WRIEEjKDAYYBiQGRAAKeBhsECQEAFAACCQAuEgAAAAAADBCI5ATkAYYICTIGBQIyAA0YE1Bva2Vtb24gRGlhbW9uZCAoVSmWHpX5d9pgcA==`<br>Please adjust this to meet your ruleset requirements.

## Patch Modification List:
| **Update** | **Details** |
|:-:|:-|
| **Rowan Skip** | Rowan Introduction skip and faster character selection. |
| **Options QoL** | Set mode on by default. Many thanks to Blue Honey for help with the Hex edits. |
| **Dialogue Skip** | Massive dialogue overhaul from the moment you start to the Hall of Fame. Less yapping, faster battling. |
| **Hands-free Briefcase** | No buttons required through Lake Verity dialogue.<br>Many areas have incredibly fragile code (in terms of randomiser compatibility). Game interactions have been shortened as much as possible while maintaining the ability to successfully randomise the ROM. |
| **Nat. Dex** | Acquire the National Dex when Rowan gives you the Pokédex inside Sandgem Lab. |
| **Faster Healing** | Faster healing at Pokémon Centers. |
| **Name Raters** | Name rater NPC Psyducks in all Pokémon Centers. |
| **Friendship NPC (Sandgem)** | Added a friendship-increasing NPC (now with no limitations). |
| **Tutorial Skip** | Removed the catching tutorial on Route 202. |
| **Expanded Pokétch** | Loaded the Pokétch with the Clock, Memo Pad, Pedometer, Pokémon List, Pokémon History & Color Changer apps when you first pick it up. |
| **Faster Fishing** | Fishing with the Old Rod has a 100% encounter rate. |
| **Moved NPCs** | Minor specific NPC repositioning to minimise movement for the player. |
| **Faster HMs** | All HM moves no longer require a Yes/No input from the player to use in the overworld. |
| **Honey Pivots** | Honey trees now no longer require a 6-hour in-game wait to encounter and are instead instantaneous. |
| **All-day Trainers** | Removed limitations on trainers who battle at specific times of the day. The Seven Stars Restaurant is now open 24-hours. |
| **No Sinking** | Removed sinking tiles in the marshy areas and deep snow where applicable. |
| **Iron Island * Trainer** | Spinning trainer made static in Iron Island. This is to guarantee avoiding the in-dungeon battle before being allowed to do so (no battles before mandatory continuous NPC healing). |

### I have created two versions of the patch.<br>The .xDelta file with FLX at the end will have the frame limiter switched off (faster).
I highly recommend using the FLX version.
